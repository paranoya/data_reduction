Data reduction scripts to illustrate different steps of the process:

## Photometry

1. Master files
    - Master bias
    - Master dark
    - Master flat
2. Basic reduction
    - Bias, dark, and flat correction
    - Sky subtraction and source detection
    - Image stacking
3. Flux calibration
    - Sources within the image
    - Bouger line

All these steps may be carry out independently, and they are, to a large extent, optional. The two methods (3a and 3b) for flux calibration are also alternative, and mutually exclusive.

## Spectroscopy

At the time, I've just uploaded the work done by David San Andres de Pedro and Jaume Zuriaga Puig in 2021.
